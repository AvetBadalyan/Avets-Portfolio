        Since 2021, I've built my expertise in Frontend Development, starting
        with foundations at <b>Microsoft IC Armenia</b> and{' '}

        While maintaining strong frontend skills, I'm continuously expanding

        clean code and innovative solutions, I build interactive applications
        that deliver exceptional user experiences while staying current with
        industry best practices.
